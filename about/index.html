        <h1 class="beta">We build websites for humans</h1>

        <p>Fizzy Inc is a small web design and development firm. We design elegant, practical web solutions for brilliant entrepreneurs, insightful bloggers, and innovative companies.</p>

        <p>Our process is straightforward and effective: we get to know your strengths, we build your site, and we make it easy for you to maintain and update your content.</p>

        <p>Collaboration is what we do best. Have an idea for a new project? We can bring your vision to life. Need to hit refresh on a stale site? Rather than slapping on cosmetic band-aids, we get under the hood, clean up code, and re-structure content. The result is a new site that not only looks pretty, but also loads quickly and responds to context. Even if you are not quite sure what you want or what you need, we’ve got you covered. Just drop us a line: translating technical jargon is what we do best.</p>

        <p>We’d love to <a href="#">hear from you</a>.</p>

        <h2>What's our story?</h2>

        <p>Fizzy Media was conceived as a space for the creative translation of ideas to the medium of the internet. Both Paul and I were in school full time when we incorporated, law for me, philosophy for him. Our expressed intent in founding was to have a place to collaborate on the various ideas we came across in our work and to have an outlet completely different from our studies.</p>

        <p>An element of concrete, hands-on work in an otherwise purely exclusively scholastic existence. We named this extension of ourselves after the gin fizzes the protagonist of Walker Percy’s Love in the Ruins finds irresistible.</p>
