                <p>Sometimes you say “no” to a customer request because it is beyond you. When I first started selling myself as a web developer I was forced to do this often because of my own skill limitations. I would push the envelope often and learn as a result, but I also had to own up and turn away projects and requests that surpassed what I could learn in the time allotted.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>Sometimes you say “no” to a customer request because you are confident enough in your work and in your client flow that you can choose who and what you would like to work with.<sup><a href="#fn-item1" id="fn-return1">1</a></sup></p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>I am not there yet.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>I have bills to pay and mouths to feed. I am relatively new to this whole code game. I know a lot, but maybe not enough. Always “maybe not enough.” So I continue learning, hanging on to the clients I have and making concessions to the clients I acquire as I develop my portfolio and become more confident in my code.</p>

                    <p>The problem is, I feel fractured, and I know it.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>I do not have the time to work on the things I love because I am busy learning the tangent required for a client. Languages I see no future and have no interest in purely for the paycheck.<sup><a href="#fn-item2" id="fn-return2">2</a></sup> Part of me says, “You cannot complain, they are paying you well.” The other part says, “Ah, but the opportunity cost. You are not having fun. It takes you longer and drains your creative energy well. You do not plan on using this ever again.” Is it worth it? No, not as I have practiced it so far. This is why <a href="#">Taylor Black</a> says:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>This is where I need to be humble enough to say “no” to particular requests, not because I <em>cannot</em> do them, but because I <em>should</em> not. Humility is the cure, I think, to this aching fear behind the reticence to say “no.”</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>There is a nobility in this “no” as well, one that I should not conflate with the inability of my early code years. I have ability. I have skill. I have time. I want to spend it on the things I love.</p>

                <p>But there is a humility in this “no” as well. I am not the best person for the specific task that you need done. It is outside of my scope in the sense that it would take more than I have to give of my time and energy. Please keep me on the job, but give this task to someone else.</p>

                <p>Discerning when to say “no” won’t be easy, but it it will be worth it.</p>
